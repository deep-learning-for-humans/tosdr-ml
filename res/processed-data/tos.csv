 when you visit virgin.com, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:  analytical and performance cookies  we may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting. analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of virgin.com by using cookies. they allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the site, how long they stay and how visitors move around our site when they are using it. this helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily. the information generated relating to the site may be used to create reports about the use of the site and the analytics service provider will store this information.  advertising and targeting cookies  these cookies record your visit to virgin.com, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other sites. we will use this information to try and make our site and other sites that you visit more relevant to your interests. we may also share this information with others, such as other virgin companies and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose. we work with technology partners to support our website and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of other virgin companies both on virgin.com and on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with. we may use cookies on our site to help us to place relevant virgin company advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites. if you are not happy for us to do this, please see the section of this policy titled “how do i turn cookies off?” below.  functionality cookies  we may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made on the site so as to provide you with a more enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.  strictly necessary cookies  these are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of our site. some cookies that we use are necessary for our site to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features.  third party cookies  because virgin and richard have a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks. we add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks. we also use facebook to power the commenting functionality on the site. when we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies. they can't read any cookies we set from virgin.com, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of virgin.com, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site. for example, if you're logged in to facebook, read a post by richard branson and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with facebook, through their plugins on our site. other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. these cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.  as at 9th october 2017, we use the following third party cookies:   mailchimp - email distribution addthis (oracle) - social sharing tools google analytics - web analytics google doubleclick - virgin advertising performance twitter - advertising targeting facebook social graph - social comment publishing facebook social plugins - advertising targeting facebook custom audience - advertising targeting aquia - virgin recommendation engine youtube.com - video player google tag manager - tag manger perfect market (taboola) - advertising targeting linked-in - advertising targeting tealium - advertising targeting  further information on the general use and function of the third party cookies listed above can be found at http://optout.aboutads.info/#/.  how do i turn cookies off?

1430,"cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. they are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service or advertising personalization. cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality. we also use other, similar types of technologies. see below for more information and examples.   what are advertising identifiers? advertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the ""identifier for advertisers"" (or idfa) on apple ios devices and the ""google advertising id"" on android devices), and certain streaming media devices. like cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.   why does netflix use cookies and advertising identifiers?   essential cookies: these cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service. for example, we and our service providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. they also help us to enforce our terms of use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.  performance and functionality cookies: these cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with netflix. for example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). we also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.  advertising cookies and advertising identifiers: these cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you. these types of ads are called ""interest-based advertising."" many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our service providers.    how can i exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers? for more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here. to opt out of interest-based ads from netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under ""privacy"" or ""ads"" in your device's settings). you may still see netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests. netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:  in the us: digital advertising alliance (daa) in europe: european interactive digital advertising alliance (edaa) in canada: ad choices: digital advertising alliance of canada (daac) / choix de pub: l'alliance de la publicité numérique du canada (daac)  at this time, we do not respond to web browser ""do not track"" signals.   how does netflix use web beacons and other technologies? web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. we and our service providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites). because web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies. we use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., html5, indexeddb, and websql). like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. we may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service. there are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies. for example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area. see your browser's help function or support area to learn more. other technologies, such as silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.",10,neutral,netflix.json
